**Folder Structure & Files:**

1. **parent folder (project name):** Main project folder.
2. **.angular:** Ignore this folder (internal caching for IDEs).
3. **.vscode:** Ignore this folder (IDE-specific configuration for Visual Studio Code).
4. **node_modules:** Installed packages for the project reside here.
5. **.editorconfig:** Custom editor settings (leave untouched unless you're an expert).
6. **.gitignore:** List of files/folders to ignore during Git commits.
7. **angular.json:** Configuration details for Angular CLI commands.
8. **package.json:** Installed dependencies of the project.
9. **package-lock.json:** Detailed breakdown of dependencies for reproducibility. Don't modify manually.
10. **tsconfig.app.json & tsconfig.spec.json:** TypeScript configuration for application and tests, respectively.
11. **README.md:** Project documentation (you're reading it!).
12. **src:** Source code of the project.
   - **app:** Contains the actual application code.
     - Each component in Angular typically has four files:
       - `<component_name>.html`: HTML template for the component's UI.
       - `<component_name>.scss/.css/.less`: Stylesheet for the component.
       - `<component_name>.spec.ts`: Unit test file for the component (using Jasmine and Karma).
       - `<component_name>.ts`: Component class (logic, data, interactions).
     - **assets:** Stores public assets (images, fonts, etc.) accessible to the application.
     - **favicon.ico:** Browser icon displayed in the address bar.
     - **index.html:** Single-page application entry point. Initializes the root Angular component.
     - **main.ts:** Application startup point, specifying the first component to render.
     - **styles.css:** Global styles for the entire project.

**Angular CLI Commands:**

```bash
npx ng version                # View project configuration
npx ng new <project_name>      # Create a new Angular project
ng generate                   # Generate code (components, modules, services, etc.)
npx ng test                    # Run all unit tests (files ending in .spec.ts)
npx ng serve                   # Start development server
npx ng build                   # Build for production (creates a 'dist' folder)
npx ng add @angular/material   # Add
